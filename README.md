# Facial-Keypoint-Detection
this repository contains code for training a facial keypoint detection model (which is multi-regression problem, since we have to detect multiple coordinates/points from one single image) in pytorch. the dataset used for training the model can be found [here](https://github.com/udacity/P1_Facial_Keypoints). corresponding kaggle notebook for direct use of code can be found [here](https://www.kaggle.com/code/sarthak333/facial-keypoint-detection).
